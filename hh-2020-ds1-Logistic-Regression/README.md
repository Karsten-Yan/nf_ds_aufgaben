# Logistic Regression

In this repository, you will learn about logistic regression.

## The way to success:

Please work together as **Pair-Programmers** through all the notebooks
in this particular order:

0. **Unzip Data folder**
1. Logistic Regression Codealong
2. Logistic Regression Codealong 2
3. Logistic Regression Titanic Example
4. Logistic Regression Exercise

The two Codealong notebook will show you how logistic regression works graphically
and with scikit-learn.
In the third notebook, you will find an example on real world data using logistic regression
to predict the survival of passengers on the Titanic.
In the forth notebook, it's your time to implement logistic regression
on a new data set.
