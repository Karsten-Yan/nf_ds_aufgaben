# Linear Regression

The first model you will learn is linear regression.
In this repository there is always a Code-along that will
help you understand the mathematical model and how to
implement it in python.
Afterwards you have the chance to test your knowledge in 
an exercise. 
Make sure, that you give yourself the chance to code twice:
In the Code-along by typing the code by yourself again and 
by testing this new knowledge in the exercises.
Don't worry if you cannot remember every line of code.
For each Data Scientist it is normal, to look up some
code snippets all the time!

## The way to success:

Please **work in pairs**  through all the notebooks
in this particular order:

0. **Unzip Data folder**
1. Linear Regression
2. Limitation of Linear Regression
3. Linear Regression Exercise 1
4. Multiple Regression
5. Multiple Regression Exercise 1
(only to check your work:)
6. Multiple Regression Exercise 1 Solutions
7. Categorical Variables

Keep in mind, you succeed better as a team.
There are NO stupid questions! 
If you already feel comfortable with the concepts,
you might even learn more from teaching them!
