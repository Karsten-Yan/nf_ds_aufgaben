# Gradient Descent

The Objective of ANY Machine Learning
Model is to find parameters, weights or a structure 
that minimizes the Cost function.

A way to minimize the Cost function
is **Gradient Descent**.
We want to dive deep into this very
basic ML method and try to understand
Gradient Descent on a very granular
level.

## The way to success:

Please work together as **Pair-Programmers** through all the notebooks
in this particular order:

1. Gradient_Descent_Codealong
2. Gradient_Descent_Codealong_Exercise_Documenteveryline
3. Gradient_Descent_Write_your_own

In the first notebook, you will see code, that
conduct every step of the Gradient Descent.
Use this notebook, to really write this code once 
for your team yourself.
In the next notebook, your task is to
*document* your writen code.
This is one of the tasks of every good Data Scientist.
It will help you understand every single line
of the code and will help you and others
in the future to understand the intention
of every single line of code.
In the third notebook, it is your task, to
build Gradient Descent again from scratch. 

Keep in mind, you succeed better as a team.
There are NO stupid questions! 
If you already feel comfortable with the concepts,
you might even learn more from teaching them!
