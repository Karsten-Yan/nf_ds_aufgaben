# Intro to Pandas and Numpy

In this repository we will continue our 
journey through the Pandas library 
 and start working with one other 
fundamental packages for scientific 
computing in Python, called Numpy.


## The way to success:

Please **work in pairs** as a team through all the notebooks
in this particular order:

0. **Unzip the folder data.zip** 
1. Pandas
2. Exploratory Data Analysis Exercise 1
3. Pandas Exercise 2
4. Numpy Pandas
5. Pandas Exercise 3

Remember the roles in pair-programming! 
Be respectful, talk to each other, explain what you are doing.
As navigator think ahead and make suggestions.
Keep in mind, you succeed better as a team.
There are NO stupid questions! 
If you already feel comfortable with the concepts,
you might even learn more from teaching them!
