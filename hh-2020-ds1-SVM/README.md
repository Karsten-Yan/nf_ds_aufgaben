# SVM 2

In this repository, you will learn more ensemble methods. 

## The way to success:

Please work together as **Pair-Programmers** through the notebook

0. **Unzip Data Folder**
1. SVM Cancer 
2. SVM 2

In the first notebook you can see an example of the implementation
SVM on a cancer dataset. In the end, it is time for you to test other 
kernels to see the influence of different kernel methods on a practical example.
The second notebook is an extract from the Python Data Science Handbook.
It illustrates to a great extent the method of maximising the margin of
the decision boundary.
