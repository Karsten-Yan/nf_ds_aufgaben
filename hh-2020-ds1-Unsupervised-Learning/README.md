# Unsupervised Learning

In this repository, you will learn many different 
unsupervised learning algorithms. 

## The way to success:

Please work together as **Pair-Programmers** through the notebook

0. **Unzip Data Folder**
1. Clustering metrics
2. K-Means Clustering Practice
3. Clustering with dim reduction
4. K-means clustering GMM
5. Mean Shift Clustering
6. Hierarchical Clustering
7. DBScan Clustering
8. Principal Component Analysis
9. Affinity Propagation
10. t-SNE

Each notebook focuses on different techniques of unsupervised learning.
The goal of the notebooks is to show which algorithm should be used for which data. 
For this purpose, partly real data is used, partly data is created to visualize the results of the methods.


In notebook 3, dimensional reduction is used in combination with k-means
clustering. Don't get so fixated on the dimensional reduction part, as there
is an extra notebook, only explaining this topic.
