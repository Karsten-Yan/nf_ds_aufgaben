# Artificial Neural Network

In this repository, you will learn one way
to implement ANN in Python, without using extra designed
Deep Learning Packages. This way, you will gain insight knowledge
on how the modules of these Packages work. 


## The way to success:

Please work together as **Pair-Programmers** through the notebook

0. **Unzip *all* data folders**
1. Artificial Neural Network Codealong
