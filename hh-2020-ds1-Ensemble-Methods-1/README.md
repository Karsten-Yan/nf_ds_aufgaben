# Random Forest

In this repository you will learn about Random Forest. 

## The way to success:

Please work together as **Pair-Programmers** through all the notebooks
in this particular order:

0. **Unzip Data folder**
1. Random Forest Codealong
2. Random Forest Tutorial
3. Random Forest Example on Lending Club Data
4. Ensemble Methods Part 1

The first notebook will show you how to implement
Random Forest with Sklearn, 
in the second notebook, Decision Trees and Random Forests are compared.
You should be able to go through the whole notebook, but just in case
some environmental problems occur (some packages cannot be imported etc.) please use
the notebook "2-Random_Forest_Tutorial_READ_ONLY.ipynb" and **don't run any cell** just
read to understand the main concepts.
The third notebook applies the random forest algorithm on
Lending Club Data. 
In the third notebook, you have the chance to create 
your own Decision Tree Algorithm with the help of a blog post!
The forth notebook contains pseudo-code, how different Ensemble Methods work.
Furthermore, it contains code snippets that could be useful for you in
your next project. Just look at them and try to understand them. You cannot run them
in this notebook, as a specific data set is missing.
