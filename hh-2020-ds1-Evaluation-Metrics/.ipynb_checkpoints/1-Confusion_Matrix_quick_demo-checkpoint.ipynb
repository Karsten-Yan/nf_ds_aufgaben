    "Sometimes, our model may be focused on a problem where False Positives are much worse than False Negatives, or vice versa. For instance, detecting credit card fraud. A False Positive would be when our model flags a transaction as fraudulent, and it isn't. This results in a slightly annoyed customer. On the other hand, a False Negative might be a fraudulent transaction that the company mistakenly lets through as normal consumer behavior. In this case, the credit card company could be on the hook for reimbursing the customer for thousands of dollars because they missed the signs that the transaction was fraudulent! Although being wrong is never ideal, it makes sense that credit card companies tend to build their models to be a bit too sensitive, because having a high recall saves them more money than having a high precision score."
