# Evaluation Metrics for Regression and Classification Problems

In this tutorial, we practice evaluation metrics 
using Python's scikit-learn. 
But also, you will learn a deep understanding
of them by implementing some of the by yourself.

## The way to success:

Please work together as **Pair-Programmers** through all the notebooks
in this particular order:

0. **Unzip Data folder**
1. Confusion_Matrix_quick_demo
2. Classification_metrics_sklearn_Codealong
3. Regression_metrics

The first notebook will give you background
information on the confusion matrix and why
why it is important to choose the right metric for the existing problem.

In the next two notebooks you will learn about classification
and regression metrics, how to implement them
with scikit-learn and by yourself.
