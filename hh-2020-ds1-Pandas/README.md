# Intro to Pandas

This is going to be the start of our 
journey through the Pandas library 
(created by Wes McKinney).

Mostly you will learn how to handle 
Pandas DataFrames and how to interact.
In the end, you will also learn how
to visualize your Data.

## The way to success:

Please **work in pairs** as a team through all the notebooks
in this particular order:

0. **Unzip the folder data.zip**
1. Intro-to-Pandas
2. Pandas-Exercise
3. Visualization 

Remember the roles in pair-programming! 
Be respectful, talk to each other, explain what you are doing.
As navigator think ahead and make suggestions.
Keep in mind, you succeed better as a team.
There are NO stupid questions! 
If you already feel comfortable with the concepts,
you might even learn more from teaching them!
