# Ensemble Methods Part 2

In this repository, you will learn more ensemble methods. 

## The way to success:

Please work together as **Pair-Programmers** through all the notebooks
in this particular order:

0. **Unzip Data folder**
1. Ensemble Methods Part 1 (exactly the same notebook as in Repo "Ensemble Methods 1")
2. Developing XGBoost Model Codealong
3. Adaboost Codealong
4. Comparison of several supervised algorithms on Adult Income Data Set

The first notebook contains pseudo-code, how different Ensemble Methods work.
Furthermore, it contains code snippets that could be useful for you in
your next project. Just look at them and try to understand them. You cannot run them
in this notebook, as a specific data set is missing.

Use the second Notebook to implement your first XGBoost Model. Here, the 
blog-post will help you with this. Keep in mind, that it will be very helpful
to comment everything, that you can understand the code also some days/weeks later.

In the third notebook, functions for the Adaboost Model are stored.
Please comment/document what the functions are doing on a granular level.

In the fourth notebook, a Decision Tree, SVM and AdaBoost Classifier are compared.
For this comparison a Census Data Set on Adult Income is used. See for yourself, 
how the algorithms perform in terms of speed in training and predicting as well as test and training accuracy.
